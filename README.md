I have created this website for simple design, I only used plain HTML5 and CSS3 languages.

JS or external libraries have not used, I was trying to design something new and basic.

Design is not responsive, you can tweak it to make it responsive.

You can copy, edit, share. (You can do whatever you want.)

Have a great day.
