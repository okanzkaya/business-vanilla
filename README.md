I have created this website for simple design, I only used plain HTML5 and CSS3 languages.

JS or external libraries have not used, I was trying to design something new.

Design is not responsive, you can tweak it to make it responsive.

You can copy, edit, share. (You can do whatever you want.)

Have a great day.
